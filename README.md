## Contents

The code, plots, datas, etc. are sorted as follows:

* `data/` - various bits of required data
* `erec/` - main body of the code
* `notebooks/` - Ipython notebooks for plotting and going through the code
* `plots/` - plots get put here

## Requirements

The code is all written in python3 and makes substantial use of the standard numpy, matplotlib, scipy etc. There are several additional libraries that you may need to investigate depending on your installation:

* [`cmocean`](https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/), aesthetic colormaps
* [`iminuit`](https://iminuit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), used for maximum likelihood code

# The Results
Each plot can be recreated in a fairly self-contained fashion. Here is each figure in the paper in order and links to a notebook to see how it was made.
